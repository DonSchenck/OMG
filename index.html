					<aside class="notes">
						So I decided to create an open source project.

				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>How do I even...?</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							With no idea where to start.
						</aside>
						</section>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>You need an idea</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						The first thing you need is a good idea. This seems obvious, but is it a GOOD idea? Will it be used? Does it fill a need? Has it been done before?
					</aside>

					<h2>
						Problem #1: What's in a name?
					</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						Naming your project is a challenge. Is the name already being used? Does the name you choose directly relate to your project? Is it a "cute" name that will leave folks confused. This is not easy; give it a lot of thought.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Stackinator</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						My first naming idea...
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Stackinator 5000</h2>
					<p>"Hey Don ... whatcha doin'?"
					</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						But that was too much Phineas and Ferb.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>PowerStackinator</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						Terrible. Too long, sounds like a pickup truck or firewood tool.

					<aside class="notes">
						OK now I'm way off the mark.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>PoshStack</h2>
					<p>Posh = common shorthand for PowerShell<br>Stack = OpenStack
						<aside class="notes">
							Finally ... THIS works!
						</aside>
						</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Problem #2: Where to put it?</h2>
					<p>
					</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						Where will you put your project? If it's YOUR project, feel free to put it in your own Github account. But if it's a part of your job, you might want to put it in your company's account. If your workplace doesn't have a Github account, guess what: You have the opportunity to start something!
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<img src=/img/zombies_here.jpg />
					<aside class="notes">
						Just make sure it's in a place where it will be safe and seen for a long time.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>github.com/DonSchenck/PoshStack
					</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						Of course, I chose my own account ... which was a mistake; the code was directly related to OpenStack, a Rackspace project. I SHOULD have put it in the Rackspace account.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<img src=/img/one_pathetic_loser.gif height=400 />
					<aside class="notes">
						So there's a good mistake to avoid.
					</aside>

					<h2>What's a good first commit?</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						What should be your first, commit ... and a good one?
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Nailing the README.md</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						THE README.md should be your first commit. THIS is VERY important.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<img src=/img/readme_pic.png />
					<aside class="notes">
						This, to be honest, is a good README.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>README should include:</h2>
					<p class="fragment">Description</p>
					<p class="fragment">Installation instructions</p>
						<p class="fragment">Configuration information</p>
						<p class="fragment">How to contribute</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						Make sure you make it easy for others to contribute.
					</aside>

					<h2>Markdown ??</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						Wait; Now I have to learn Markdown??
					</aside>
				</section>

						<p class="fragment"><img src=/img/gfm.png />
						</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							Github Flavored Markdown
						</aside>
					</section>
				<section>
					<h2>What about that second commit?</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						How about a document outlining the project?
						How about the first piece of working code, something that demonstrates the approach it takes, i.e. frameworks, standards, etc.?
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Oh, hey! ... Let's do another commit!</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						So now what happens is that you start to get rolling...
					</aside>

				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>And another!</h2>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>This is fun!</h2>
				</section>
				<section>
					<img src=/img/stop_sign.jpg />
					<aside class="notes">
						Just stop.
						Wait.
						Think.
						At this point, ask yourself some questions:
						Is this heading in the right direction?
						Will some serious changes need to be made. BREAKING changes?
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>This is a public project</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
Remember; This is for public consumption. You may be two or three commits into it and already have people using this code. YOU NEED TO PROCEED CAREFULLY AND WITH A PLAN!					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>So, what is a good cadence?</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						What is a good cadence? Let's talk about issues.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>I have Issues</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						Ever since I was cut from the 8th grade basketball teamâ€¦
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>No, seriously; Use Github Issues</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						Take the time necessary and plan ahead. Map out a development plan. Break it down into small, easily-completed steps, and turn those steps into Issues.
						For my project, I created one issue for each SDK function.
						That resulted in...
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>236 Issues?</h2>
					<p>What the...??
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>This would be a good time...</h2>
					<img src=/img/Scotch.jpg />
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>PoshHub</h2>
					<p>A side trip
					</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						Don't be surprised if your project spawns another project. In my case, I wrote a PowerShell client for Github to make it easier for me to create Issues for my PoshStack project.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<img src=/img/PoshHub_commits.png />
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Milestones</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						Use them.
						Don't make them too big. I did; You should not.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<img src=/img/milestones.png />
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Enter Waffle.io</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						Really nice tool; check it out.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<img src="/img/waffle_io.png" />
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Gitter.im</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						Another great tool.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<img src="/img/gitter_im.png" />
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Oh glorious day!</h2>
					<p>My first Pull Request
					</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						When someone else contributes to your project, the feeling is AWESOME! SOMEONE notices your work! It has value!
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Fire up the PR engine, we're going global</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						This is when you start to feel like you're making progress.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Feedback! YAY ... FEEDBACK!</h2>
					<p>Uh...
					</p>
					<aside class="notes">
							BUT ... the feedback might be negative!
					</aside>
					</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Wait...I did what wrong?</h2>
					<p class="fragment">Naming: No plurals</p>
					<p class="fragment">What about security?</p>
						<p class="fragment">What about signing the modules?</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							Get ready for some *serious* constructive criticism. Don't be thinned-skinned; put on the fire suit and get ready. Take EVERYTHING as a POSITIVE intention.
						</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>I TOLD YOU This is a public project!</h2>
					<p class="fragment">YOU don't own this; it's a *public* project. It's open to public discussion and criticism and...</p>
					<p class="fragment">...public bug reporting, and...</p>
					<p class="fragment">...public HELP! (yay)</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>"We accept Pull Requests"</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
							Remember this phrase if anyone is overly critical of your project. After all, they're free to contribute. Don't let anyone make you feel like YOU must support THEIR needs.
						</aside>
					</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Help is on the way</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						People will start to take an interest.
						It may start as emails, which YOU need to turn into Issues.
						Encourage folks to CREATE ISSUES.
						Don't forget where you need help: NOT just code ... documentation ... tests ... sample code.

						Well-intentioned people may show interest but never show up to help.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>The lull</h2>
					<p>Nothing. Crickets.
This is when you bear down and start The Work. You write code, you write documentation, you write sample code, you keep publicizing the effort and asking for help.
DO. NOT. QUIT.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Licensing?</h2>
					<p>LICENSING!<br>
					</p>
					<aside class="notes">Apache 2.0 License seems to be the most liberal
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Regaining lost momemtum</h2>
					<p>I.e. now it's work
					</p>
					<aside class="notes">
							This is the tough time. When the project isn't really ready for Prime Time but might have some users. Before a project "takes off", this is WORK.
						</aside>
					</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Moving forward...</h2>
					<p>Does it have an end point, or does it constantly evolve?
					</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						Some projects have an "end point" (except for bug fixes) while others will go on forever, i.e. future versions. Think is a simple utilty versus a programming language.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>DO EET!</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
							Here's the thing: No matter what your idea, get started and DO IT!!
